in cmd

$ node -v

to see if Node is installed

Install NodeJS

in cmd

$ npm install -g create-react-app

-g so its installed globally so we can run it from the terminal
create-react-app is the package we want to install, used to create react projects

$ cd to project folder

To create a new project

$ create-react-app project-name

or

$ npx create-react-app project-name

cmd says:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Success! Created jsx at C:\Users\Maria\Desktop\react\Udemy\jsx
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd jsx
  yarn start

Happy hacking!
